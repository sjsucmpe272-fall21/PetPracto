Problem Statement
The security of the client  of a bank over the call can be breached if a person has the details of the client. To ensure that it is the client himself asking for making changes or requesting something from the bank, identification of the client is a crucial and important aspect. Over the call mostly the identification is based on information previously provided by the client. But if the intruder has the details, it can be easy for him to access the bank account. Not just the bank but indeed wherever identification is required, the speech recognition can be beneficial and can make the identification process easier and secure. 

Abstract
The voice can be used to identify the person, so a user's voice can be saved for our dataset, and later on a machine learning model can be trained for that dataset. Which can later on be used for identification of a user.

Approach
Similar to face recognition, security over the voice call can be made using speech recognition. 
Initially the data of the user will be collected i.e voice recordings of the user.
This data will be the input for our machine learning model. 
Based on the model whenever a test dataset is provided, the model can predict if it is the user or not.

Persona
Identification of the clients whenever the services provided by the company are over calls.
