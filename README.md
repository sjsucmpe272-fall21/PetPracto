# 1) Introduction to the problem statement

> The idea of owning pets seems so refreshing and why not? There are many benefits of owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise, help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship, increase immunity, help with home safety and whatnot.

> But a lot goes into taking care of the health of your pet, especially for pet owners who are new to this.

> New pet owners at times don't understand their pet's behaviour or the pet may show some symptoms that may or may not be related to some underlying illness which sometimes is difficult to diagnose. 
> People can benefit from this website at their choice of time; be it at comfort and safety of their home, living in remote locations or those who do not have many facilities nearby may face problems and could even lose their pets if the symptoms are left undiagnosed.


# 2) Abstract:
> We want to build a one-stop website to help people connect with professional vets as well as experienced pet owners nearby. The website will provide them with a portal for online consultations from trained vet doctors and alongside provide an online health store for prescribed pet medicines and pet daily needs so they do not need to go out and search for their pet prescription. As an added functionality, the website will also have map directions for pet parks to connect and socialize with other pet and pet owners nearby.


# 3) Approach
> Adding a Google map API we can show the nearby pet owners or pet parks on our website: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map
